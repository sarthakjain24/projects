    /// <summary>
    /// An AbstractSpreadsheet object represents the state of a simple spreadsheet.  A 
    /// spreadsheet consists of an infinite number of named cells.
    /// 
    /// A string is a cell name if and only if it consists of one or more letters,
    /// followed by one or more digits AND it satisfies the predicate IsValid.
    /// For example, "A15", "a15", "XY032", and "BC7" are cell names so long as they
    /// satisfy IsValid.  On the other hand, "Z", "X_", and "hello" are not cell names,
    /// regardless of IsValid.
    /// 
    /// Any valid incoming cell name, whether passed as a parameter or embedded in a formula,
    /// must be normalized with the Normalize method before it is used by or saved in 
    /// this spreadsheet.  For example, if Normalize is s => s.ToUpper(), then
    /// the Formula "x3+a5" should be converted to "X3+A5" before use.
    /// 
    /// A spreadsheet contains a cell corresponding to every possible cell name.  
    /// In addition to a name, each cell has a contents and a value.  The distinction is
    /// important.
    /// 
    /// The contents of a cell can be (1) a string, (2) a double, or (3) a Formula.  If the
    /// contents is an empty string, we say that the cell is empty.  (By analogy, the contents
    /// of a cell in Excel is what is displayed on the editing line when the cell is selected.)
    /// 
    /// In a new spreadsheet, the contents of every cell is the empty string.
    ///  
    /// The value of a cell can be (1) a string, (2) a double, or (3) a FormulaError.  
    /// (By analogy, the value of an Excel cell is what is displayed in that cell's position
    /// in the grid.)
    /// 
    /// If a cell's contents is a string, its value is that string.
    /// 
    /// If a cell's contents is a double, its value is that double.
    /// 
    /// If a cell's contents is a Formula, its value is either a double or a FormulaError,
    /// as reported by the Evaluate method of the Formula class.  The value of a Formula,
    /// of course, can depend on the values of variables.  The value of a variable is the 
    /// value of the spreadsheet cell it names (if that cell's value is a double) or 
    /// is undefined (otherwise).
    /// 
    /// Spreadsheets are never allowed to contain a combination of Formulas that establish
    /// a circular dependency.  A circular dependency exists when a cell depends on itself.
    /// For example, suppose that A1 contains B1*2, B1 contains C1*2, and C1 contains A1*2.
    /// A1 depends on B1, which depends on C1, which depends on A1.  That's a circular
    /// dependency.
