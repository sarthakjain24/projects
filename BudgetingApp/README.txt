A Budgeting App made to budget based on needs, wants, and savings, and based on the total money available. You can seperate the money into the needs, wants, and savings based on the name and the price of the item. It is also possible to view the expenses, edit them, and remove them as well. In this application, you can create a new form, open a new form as well as save them. 

This project was made personally in order to keep track of finances, because as a college student it can be easy to spend a lot of money, and I use this in order to make sure that I budget properly and don't overspend.
